# Express.js: Missing Response in Request Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where the server fails to respond to HTTP requests because the request handler omits sending a response using `res.send()`, `res.json()`, or a similar method.

## Bug Description

The server starts successfully, but requests to the `/` endpoint result in no response from the server.  The client will experience a timeout or hang. This happens because the `request handler` lacks a mechanism to send a response back to the client. Although the server logs a message indicating a request was received, this does not fulfill the client request.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Attempt to access `http://localhost:3000/` in a web browser or using a tool like `curl`.  You will likely see a timeout or a blank page.

## Solution

The solution is simply to add `res.send()` (or `res.json()` for JSON responses) inside the request handler to explicitly send a response to the client.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Additional notes:

This error can be frustrating to debug because it might appear that the server is unresponsive for reasons unrelated to the missing response, and console logs alone may not indicate it. 
Proper handling of requests and responses is critical to build reliable Express.js applications.
